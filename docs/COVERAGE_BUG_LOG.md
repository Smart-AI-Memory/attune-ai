# Coverage Bug Log

Append-only log of bugs surfaced while pushing module coverage toward 100%.
The thesis: branches that resist coverage are signal — almost always one of
three patterns.

**Bug classes**

1. **Crash paths nobody triggered** — production code that throws on real
   input but had no test exercising the path.
2. **Dead code wearing defensive-coding clothes** — code that looks defensive
   but is unreachable, which means it's also untested and couldn't actually
   defend.
3. **Tests that mocked around the bug** — tests pass because they mock the
   broken caller; coverage at 100% looks fine, production code is wrong.

Format: most recent session at top. Per bug: `module — class — one-liner`.

## 2026-05-09 — session 49c (Opus 4.7)

13 modules pushed to 100% (or accepted ~98% for partial for-loop branches).
**2 production bugs surfaced** — both Class 2 (dead defensive code).

### Modules — 0 bugs

- `socratic/feedback_models.py` — 91.53% → 100% (4 zero-use guard branches in
  `get_score_for_context`)
- `socratic/collaboration_models.py` — 93.55% → 100% (roundtrip serialization
  for Comment/Vote/Change/CollaborativeSession + VotingResult.approval_rate
  zero-active branch)
- `socratic/success_models.py` — 93.92% → 100% (BOOLEAN-with-non-bool
  fall-through, LOWER_IS_BETTER no-max, RANGE infinite size, unknown
  direction default)
- `socratic/ascii_visualizer.py` — 90.00% → 100% (>3 tools, long agent string
  truncation, parallel marker, _center text-wider-than-width, empty-stage
  agent listing skip)
- `socratic/generator.py` — 95.45% → 100% (unknown-template skip,
  reporter-only/generator-only stages, real `_create_xml_agent`)
- `socratic/html_renderer.py` — 96.30% → 100% (show_when data attribute,
  option description span)
- `socratic/ab_testing/models.py` — 97.85% → 100% (avg_success_score
  zero-impressions short-circuit)
- `socratic/session.py` — 93.50% → 100% (can_generate at max_rounds,
  from_dict goal_analysis reconstruction)
- `workflows/progress.py` — 69.01% → 100% (full ProgressTracker lifecycle:
  callback errors, stage start/complete/fail/skip/fallback/retry, async
  callback path, factory)

### Bugs — Class 2 (dead defensive code)

- `socratic/explainer.py` — Defensive default `return explanation.to_markdown()`
  after the `OutputFormat` enum chain (TEXT/MARKDOWN/HTML/JSON all explicitly
  handled). The enum has exactly four values, all covered above. Removed and
  collapsed JSON branch into the natural-fall-through path.
- `socratic/ab_testing/allocator.py` — Defensive default
  `return self._fixed_allocation(user_id)` after the `AllocationStrategy`
  enum chain (FIXED/EPSILON_GREEDY/THOMPSON_SAMPLING/UCB all explicitly
  handled). Same pattern: 4 enum values, all covered. Replaced final
  `if`-check with direct `return self._ucb_allocation()`.

Both bugs are sub-pattern A of Class 2 — **"defensive default after
exhaustive enum dispatch."** Same shape, same fix. This is at least the
fourth instance of this exact pattern (also seen in
`meta_orch_estimation.py`, `meta_orch_analysis.py`, and `retry.py` post-loop
fallback variants).

## 2026-05-09 — session 49b (Opus 4.7)

6 additional modules pushed to 100% (or accepted ~96% for module-import
unreachable code). **0 production bugs surfaced.** Absence of bugs is also
data — these modules were already well-tested at edges; the coverage gaps
were genuine missing tests, not hidden defects.

- `resilience/circuit_breaker.py` — 87.93% → 100%
- `workflows/escalation/convenience.py` — 88.89% → 100%
- `workflows/progress_models.py` — 98.18% → 100%
- `workflows/state_mixin.py` — 97.67% → 100%
- `workflows/progress.py` — 69.01% → 100% (new test_progress_tracker.py)
- `workflows/telemetry_mixin.py` — 87.34% → 96.20% (module-import
  ImportError fallback at lines 29-31 is unreachable post-import; accepted)

## 2026-05-09 — session 49 (Opus 4.7)

11 modules pushed to 100%. 4 production bugs surfaced.

- `socratic/cli_console.py` — **class 1** — `Console.table()` raised
  `IndexError` when a row had more cells than headers (guard existed in the
  width-calculation loop, missing in the print loop). Fixed by mirroring the
  guard.
- `orchestration/meta_orchestrator.py` — **class 1** — `compose_team()` read
  `plan.phases`, but `ExecutionPlan` has no `phases` attribute. Every call
  raised `AttributeError`. Replaced with `[]` (matches what
  `DynamicTeamBuilder.build_from_plan` defaults to).
- `orchestration/meta_orch_analysis.py` — **class 2** — `_classify_domain`
  had an unreachable for-loop-fell-through branch (the inner `return`
  always fires when `max_score > 0`). Refactored to `max(scores, key=...)`.
- `resilience/retry.py` — **class 2** — three identical post-loop blocks
  (`if last_exception: raise last_exception`) were unreachable: the loop
  always raises or returns. Removed across `async_wrapper`, `sync_wrapper`,
  and `retry_with_backoff`. Kept the `RuntimeError` fallback, which IS
  reachable when `max_attempts < 1`.

---

## Prior cumulative sessions (retroactive — recovered from session notes)

Bugs found and fixed across earlier coverage pushes. Less granular because
they predate this log.

- `socratic/feedback_collector.py` — **class 3** — infinite recursion
  between `get_insights()` and `_generate_recommendations()`. Existing tests
  passed by mocking the recursive caller. Fixed by extracting a
  `_compute_domain_insights()` helper and breaking the cycle.
- `socratic/engine.py` — **class 1** — `_generate_success_criteria`
  constructed `SuccessMetric()` without the required `description` argument.
- `meta_workflows/pattern_memory.py` — **class 2** — unreachable
  `if form_response:` block (line 233) removed.
- `meta_workflows/llm_execution.py` — **class 2** — dead
  `raise RuntimeError("No tiers attempted")` removed.
- `meta_workflows/pattern_learner.py` — **class 2** — dead
  `if failure_count > 0:` removed (creating an entry always increments past
  zero).
- `models/provider_config.py` — **class 2** — dead `if model:` filter
  removed.
- `models/telemetry/analytics.py` — **class 2** — three dead defensive
  `if x > 0:` divisor guards removed.

## Tally

| Class | Description | Count |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Crash paths nobody triggered | 3 |
| 2 | Dead defensive code | 11 |
| 3 | Tests mocking around bugs | 1 |

**Class 2 sub-patterns observed:**

- **2A — Defensive default after exhaustive enum dispatch.** A function
  switches on an enum, handles every value explicitly, then has a
  trailing default. Dead. (4+ instances: `meta_orch_estimation`,
  `meta_orch_analysis`, `explainer`, `ab_testing/allocator`.)
- **2B — Post-loop fallback after a loop that always returns/raises.**
  `for ... try: return except: raise` patterns where the loop body
  guarantees exit, but a `if last_exception: raise` block sits beneath it
  anyway. Dead. (3 instances in `retry.py`.)
- **2C — Defensive divisor guard where divisor is structurally non-zero.**
  `if x > 0:` before division, where every code path that creates the
  entry also increments past 0. Dead. (3 instances in
  `telemetry/analytics.py`, 1 in `pattern_learner.py`.)
- **2D — Filter on already-filtered data.** `if model:` filter applied to
  a list whose construction already excluded falsy entries. Dead.
  (1 instance: `provider_config.py`.)

**Sessions where 0 bugs surfaced:** 1 (session 49b).

**Bug-find rate:** 15 bugs across 78 modules pushed to 100% = ~19% of
modules contain at least one production bug surfaced by the coverage push.

Modules at 100%: 78 (cumulative across all sessions).
