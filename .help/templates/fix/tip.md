# Fix Receipts — state the goal and its probes, get a verified receipt

## Notes & tips

- Preview first. The preview costs nothing and catches malformed probes
  before a run.
- Prefer plural probes that are distinct from the fix target — a target
  probe plus a suite probe plus a scope constraint is the shape that
  actually proves something.
- The receipt distinguishes "changed nothing and the conditions already
  held" from "fixed and verified". If you see the former, check that
  your goal described a real gap.
- Probe subprocesses run with bytecode and pytest-cache writes disabled
  so their own artifacts are never mistaken for the fix's changes.
